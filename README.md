### Map App

This application uses the Google Maps API and the police.uk API to create an interactive map which shows 
police stop/search data.

Documentation on both these APIs are available here:

[https://data.police.uk/docs/](https://data.police.uk/docs/)

[https://developers.google.com/maps/](https://developers.google.com/maps/)

By default the police API returns the most recent dataset, which seems to be about 3 months behind.

Note that not all police forces publish their stop/search data.

#### Future features

* ability to search by date
* ability to search by specific features such as ethnicity, object of search etc.
* heatmap
